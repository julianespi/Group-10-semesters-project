"Computer science is the study of processes that interact with data and that can be 
represented as data in the form of programs. It enables the use of algorithms to 
manipulate, store, and communicate digital information. A computer scientist studies 
the theory of computation and the practice of designing software systems. Its fields 
can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines. Computational complexity 
theory is highly abstract, while computer graphics emphasizes real-world applications. 
Programming language theory considers approaches to the description of computational 
processes, while computer programming itself involves the use of programming languages 
and complex systems. Human–computer interaction considers the challenges in making 
computers useful, usable, and accessible."
