"Computer science explores the processes that work with data and how these processes 
can be expressed as programs. It facilitates the application of algorithms to process, 
store, and transmit digital information. A computer scientist studies 
the theory of computation and the practice of designing software systems. Its fields 
can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines. The field is generally split 
into conceptual and applied areas. For instance, computational complexity theory deals 
with abstract mathematical models, whereas computer graphics focuses on tangible 
applications. Programming language theory considers approaches to the description 
of computational processes and computer programming applies these ideas through 
code and intricate systems. Humanâ€“computer interaction tackles the difficulties 
involved in ensuring that computers are intuitive, practical, and inclusive."
